### OVERVIEW

https://www.makerinchief.com/kits.html

The Lantern Bot controls 8 strips of WS2812b LEDs to give a room some extra light. An Arduino Nano is used to control the strips which shine behind printer paper. Baltic birch plywood is laser cut to create the chassis and custom PCBs are used to ease the soldering process. A NRF24L01 radio module can be added to allow remote control.
